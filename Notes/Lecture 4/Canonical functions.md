#definition 
# Response function
A function $g$ that gives the distribution's mean as a function of the natural parameter is called the canonical response function. For example, $g(\eta) = E[T(y);\eta]$

# Link function
The inverse of the response function, $g^{-1}$, is called the canonical link function.
